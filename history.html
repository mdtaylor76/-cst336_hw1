            <h2>World's First Programmer</h2>
            <p>
                Mechanical computers have existed as far back as the 19th century.  Ada Lovelace, daughter of author and poet
                Lord Byron, published what is largely aggreed to be the first program in the 1840s.  Designed to calculate
                Bernoulli numbers and run on Charles Babbage's analytical engine, it gave Ada the distinction of being the 
                world's first programmer.  In the interveneing 180 years, over 700 programming languages have been created,
                including the Ada programming language, named afte Ada Lovelace.

            <h2>Imperative Programming Languages</h2>
            <p>
                Imperative programming is one of the two primary programming paradigms.  Imperative programming focuses on 
                how something is done.  An outcome is achieved through a specifically defined set of steps to be executed by the program.  
                Many of the most commonly used programming languages use the imperative programming paradigm starting
                with one of the first commercially available programming languages, FORTRAN.  Below you'll find a list of programming
                languages that use the imperative programming paradigm in order of release:
                <ol>
                    <li>Fortran</li>
                    <li>ALGOL</li>
                    <li>COBOL</li>
                    <li>BASIC</li>
                    <li>Assembler</li>
                    <li>Pascal</li>
                    <li>C</li>
                    <li>C++</li>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>Java</li>
                    <li>Ruby</li>
                    <li>C#</li>
                </ol>
                The imperative programming paradigm can be broken into three categories: structured, procedural, and modular.
                <ul>
                    <li>Structured - includes expanded use of control stuctures such as if/then and loops</li>
                    <li>Procedural - break down tasks into small components</li>
                    <li>Modular - aims to separate code into modules to increase ease of re-use</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Declarative Programming Paradigm</h2>
            <p>
                As opposed to the how, the Declarative Programming Paradigm is concerned more with the what.  These types of
                languages are more about logic and what is to be executed with litle regard to flow.  Markup languages such as 
                HTML and are considered declarative languages.
